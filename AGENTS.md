# Project instructions

TVW-004 is complete and independently reviewed; M0 is complete. No further issue is currently authorized. Do not begin TVW-005 or later, add geographic data/AOI coordinates, or load real-world datasets without separate user instruction. TQ1 4HN remains an unverified candidate for M2 only.

## Working protocol

1. Work on **one milestone and one focused issue** at a time. TVW-004 is complete; begin no further issue until separately authorized.
2. Start with an implementation plan, concrete files touched, tests and proof of completion.
3. Keep geographic calculations in tested Python modules and typed, documented asset contracts. No ad-hoc coordinate transforms scattered across React/Three.js render logic.
4. Maintain a **fully functioning synthetic world** at all times.
5. Do not fabricate geographic coordinates, downloaded files, measured building heights or successfully run tests.
6. Do not silently add a paid service, large dependency, API key, authentication system, container orchestration or hosted backend.
7. Use official publisher documentation and source metadata when dataset shape, CRS or licence is uncertain.
8. For each change: run quality gates, confirm local browser experience where possible, attach screenshot/observation, record blockers, and update milestone checklist.
9. Do not claim visual tests passed unless an actual browser run occurred. If Computer Use/browser access is unavailable, say so and provide precise local verification steps.
10. Keep source data separate from generated assets; preserve provenance and repeatability.
11. If a source is missing, implement a clear fallback **without pretending fake data is real**.
12. Ask for user intervention only for things Codex cannot reasonably obtain (e.g., an account-gated manual download). Continue with synthetic work rather than blocking every milestone.
13. Make small commits with meaningful messages; do not push or merge without configured repository/user permission.
14. Finish every milestone with a handback: summary, commands run, test results, screenshot links where available, known defects, and next proposed issue.
